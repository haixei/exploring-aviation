# Exploring Aviation in 2021
Aviation is a milti billion dollar industry with a long history and complex logistics. Even the smallest delays or issues could cost companies huge amount of money. With the help of machine learning we're able to forecast interest in flights, delays and other factors that impact the budget and planning. In this project I'm going to explore a few different topics based on open datasets on airports and flights.

## Legend
1. [The cost of delays](docs/eda.md)
	 - [1.1 About flight delays and their impact](docs/)
   - [1.2 Forestasting delays](docs/)
2. [Predicting the interest in flights](docs/eda.md)
	 - [2.1 Introduction to the topic](docs/)
   - [2.2 Predicting interest](docs/)
   - [2.3 Predicting prices for the best outcome](docs/)
3. [Impact of COVID-19 on aviation](docs/eda.md)
	 - [2.1 Background](docs/)
   - [2.2 Forecasting the next years (vacciness, waves etc.)](docs/)

## Goals
- [ ] Showcasing the numbers behind flights
- [ ] Making reliable predicitons on delays and interest that could potentialy save money
- [ ] Exploring the impact of the pandemic on the industry and predictions

## Data
