# Understanding & Processing The Data
Since creating the previous part about delays I've learned about few things that might help me with past issues. In this document I will try to understand the data that I'm working with without a very in-depth analysis. I'm going to focus more on feature engineering and processing the data to fit my needs accordingly to the data set statistics. 

### Key ideas:

- When working with a bigger dataset, it's useful to set up a BigQuery
- There is a way of encoding the features with a lot of categories inside called label encoding
- Blending models can show significantly better predictions
- I want to spend more time trying to create new features that could be insightful



## Exploring the data set

In this section we're going to explore the data we're working with and show some plots on distribution as well as the relationship between features and **our target - the price.**
